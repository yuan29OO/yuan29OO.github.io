	<h4>Senior Design - VR UI for Engineering Application</h4>
	<div>
		<p>Our group make a VR UI for engineering application. By creating the unique menu bars in the VR environment, people can editing the models easily.<br>
        I'm one of the programmers. And I built simple model when we designed UI. Because our group were not familiar with VR, we read many researches of VR and VR UI. We have learned Unity and C# because we have planned to use Unity and C# as primary methods to create VR UI.<br>
        We design UI in VR environment for engineering usage, but our potential users are not strictly narrow to engineers. We try to make interface as simple as possible and make every user are able to use even first time to use VR.<br><br></p>

	<h4>Mars Rover</h4>

		<p>This project is a group project of CprE 288. We developed an interplanetary rover using the VORTEX platform.<br>
        We made the rover be automatic. It navigated by the data from its attachments such as the servo, SONAR, and IR sensor. During the test, the rover should stay in the retrieval zone within 20 minutes, without bumping into tall objects, without falling into holes in the floor, without leaving the course bounded by white tape, and without having to visually confirm where our robot is on the obstacle course. In the end, when the robot detected the target, it stopped and played a short music. 
        We programmed in C language and transferred to iRobot. I mainly worked on the detection of color and how to made sound. The sensors at the bottom of iRobot could detect color and sent back data of the color. Different color had different ranges of values. I collected the values of white, red and dark grey. Then I wrote codes to make iRobot have different actions when it met different colors. In this project, I learned embedded systems and how to use them.<p>
